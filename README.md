# To-Do List

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) by Nagagu.
It has the front-end made with React js and the server side made with C# in .Net environment and Entity Framework. I have used the package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory to create a BBDD in memory since the simplicity of the example required it like this.

## Project Explanation

This project was the first I made in React js to my personal web, and because of that is very minimalist.
After doing some other projects I thought this could be the ideal one to add the backend.
With this project I wanted to show, in a very simple way, my knowledge of the two parts.
