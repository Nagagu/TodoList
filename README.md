# To-Do List

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) by Nagagu.
It has the front-end made with React js and the server part made with C# in .Net environment and Entity Framework.

## Project Explanation

This project was the first I made in React js, and because of that is very minimalist.
After doing some other projects I thought this could be the ideal one to add the server part.
In this project I wanted to show in a very simple way my knowledge of the two services.
